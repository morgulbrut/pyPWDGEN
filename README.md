# pyPWDGEN

Just some lines of python to generate strong passwords. 

## Idea

 * passwords are generated with using the first n letters of your username, the first n letters of the domainname and a n symbol long masterkey, the rest is some hashing magic.
 * the masterkey should be passed as argument when runing the script, the script then prints a list of passwords and usernames
 * domainname and username are stored in a csv file
 * passwords can be generated without a storing a username domainname.
